# This is problematic, because there is a very important non-death situation
# which moves the player to worldspawn: returning from The End if you don't
# have a valid bed.

# Legacy handling (pre-2): if the player doesn't have a spawnpoint in their
# scoreboard, set the spawnpoint to their current spawnpoint, which would have
# been set by the previous version
